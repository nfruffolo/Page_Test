<h2> Opening Statement </h2>
<p>The best opportunities in life come to those who work for them and I have no shortage of motivation to be better. This website is a representation of my work and also a representation of how I continue to grow. The layout of my portfolio and the content within it are far from static and change with the more I learn and the more I improve. However, the effort and time I put into the content will never change.
I strive to have the person behind these words not only be a good worker, but a good teammate, a good friend and a good person. In my eyes, relationships are just as important as data points on a graph when it comes to success both in and out of the office. That is why I combine personable with productive when it comes to my work philosophy. 
I hope you enjoy your time on the website and please feel free to contact me with questions, concerns or general feedback using the "contact" tab on the navigation bar.
