<h2> Opening Statement </h2>
<p>The best opportunities in life come to those who work for them and I have no shortage of motivation to be better. This website is a representation of my work and also a representation of how I continue to grow. The layout of my portfolio and the content within is far from static and changes with the more I learn and the more I improve. However, the effort and time I put into the content will never change.
<br> I strive to have the person behind these words not only be a good worker, but a good teammate, a good friend and a good person. In my eyes, relationships are just as important as data points on a graph when it comes to success both in and out of the office. That is why I combine personable with productive when it comes to my portfolio.
<br> My journey started as a staff member on my high school yearbook and changed paths from writer to reporter to television anchor to videographer and producer where I stand today. The four years at WEIU-TV in Charleston, IL. built a solid foundation and the first wall of experience is nearly complete with the Indianapolis Colts.
<br> I hope you enjoy your time on the website and please feel free to contact me with questions, concerns or general feedback using the "contact" tab on the navigation bar.
